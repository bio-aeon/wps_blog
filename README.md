## [WIP] WPS Blog
A rewritten version of my simple blog engine, as well as my playground for the practical application of technologies that are interesting to me. The engine architecture consists of several separate services.

The previous implementation as a monolithic application on Django, is kept in [this](https://github.com/bio-aeon/wps_blog/tree/feature/docker) branch.

### To do

- [ ] API service
- [ ] UI service (SPA + SSR)
- [ ] Admin service
- [ ] CI using Github Actions
